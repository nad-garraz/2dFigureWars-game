# 2D-Geometry Wars Game assignment
(check the "assignment_starts branch")

## Description
Following David Churchill's c++ game dev course on YouTube. In the main branch you will see a skeleton of the assignment. In the "assignment_starts" branch you will see my solution to the task. Thanks!

## Prerequisites
To compile and run the game, you need to have the following dependencies installed. If you have problems making SFML and ImGui, take a look at
the assignment_starts branch:

- C++ compiler (I am usign GCC)
- SFML library
- IMGUI library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/nad-garraz/2dFigureWars-game.git
```

2. Install SFML library following the instructions for your operating system: [SFML Installation Guide](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php).

3. Install IMGUI library following the instructions provided by the library documentation: [IMGUI GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   bash
   cd 2dFigureWars-game
   ```

2. Compile the game using the provided Makefile:
   ```
   bash
   make
   ```

3. Run the game:
   ```
   bash
   make run
   ```

## Cleaning Up

To remove the compiled binaries and object files, you can use the following command:
   ```
   bash
   make clean
   ```

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

- David's Churchill tutorial on YouTube.
- SFML library for providing the necessary tools for game development.
- IMGUI library for the user interface implementation.

Enjoy playing and coding this Geometry Wars!
